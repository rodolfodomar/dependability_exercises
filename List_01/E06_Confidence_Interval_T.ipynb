    "# E06: CI for a Mean with Unknown σ (t-interval)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook solves Exercise 6, focusing on the construction of a confidence interval for a population mean when the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is unknown. This is a very common scenario in practice, requiring the use of the Student's t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When we need to estimate the population mean ($\\mu$) without knowing the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$), we use the sample standard deviation ($s$) as an estimate. This introduces additional uncertainty. The Student's t-distribution is designed to account for this extra uncertainty. It is similar to the Normal distribution but has heavier tails, resulting in a wider, more conservative confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appropriateness of the t-distribution rests on two conditions:\n",
    "1.  The population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is unknown.\n",
    "2.  The sample comes from a normally distributed population, OR the sample size ($n$) is sufficiently large (typically $n \\ge 30$) for the Central Limit Theorem to apply, ensuring the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the t-interval is:\n",
    "$$ \\text{CI} = \\overline{x} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom."

    "## Step 2: Justify the Use of the t-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem asks why the t-distribution is appropriate here. There are two key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Unknown Population Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$):** The problem provides the *sample* standard deviation ($s = 32$ ms), not the population standard deviation. We are using an estimate based on our data, which is the primary condition for using the t-distribution instead of the z-distribution.\n",
    "2.  **Sufficiently Large Sample Size:** The sample size is $n=60$. Since $60 \\ge 30$, the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the sampling distribution of the sample mean ($\\overline{x}$) will be approximately Normal, even if we don't know the distribution of the underlying round-trip times. This satisfies the second condition for the valid application of the t-interval."
